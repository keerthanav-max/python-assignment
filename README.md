## Introduction to Python



Python is a popular programming language. It is used for Activities like web development, Software development, mathematics, system scripting etc. 



Python can be used on a server to create web applications. It can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems and can read and modify files. It can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics and much more.



##### History of Python



Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s and was officially released in 1991.

Python first started as his hobby project during Christmas Holidays. It was inspired by the ABC Language but Guido improved it by fixing its limitations. 



Why is Python called Python?



Python was named after the BBC comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. Guido wanted to keep the name short and a little mysterious. 



When First released, Python already supported core data types, Exception handling and functions. 

Over time Python gained popularity due to its open source nature.
